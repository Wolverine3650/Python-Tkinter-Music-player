# Python-Tkinter-Music-player
Desktop application using Python GUI (Tkinter ) and Pygame module
<p>
Before starting the introduction to this project I just want to let you know that the only important file here in this repository is <b> player.py</b>, then does that means other files and folders are not important?
Absolutely not!
I have uploaded all these files to let you know that while developing a python application or program we come across conditions where we need to install external libraries, 
so pip-installing many libraries in pc has many disadvantages in a course of time such as A version control, one more thing is just not to mess up your computer.
to avoid this problem we must create a virtual environment.<br/> 
so when you want to keep everything in your little walled garden(virtual environment) there are three simple steps:
<ul>
<li> step1: open git bash in the folder you want to create a python application </li>
<li> step2: Run command on git bash terminal : <br/>
<b>"python -m venv <name of your virtual environment>" </b> </li>
<li>step3: to start virtual environment just created, Run command: <br/>
<b>"source <name of your virtual environment>/Scripts/activate"</b></li> <br/>
for e.g. if you name your virtual environment as "virt"<br/>
>>python -m venv virt </br>
>>source virt/Scripts/activate

</ul>
</p>

<h2>That's it about the virtual environment, now let us understand the libraries used in this python application.</h2>
<ul>
libraries used in this application:
<li><b>Tkinter</b>: Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. </li>
<li><b>pygame</b>: a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.</li>
<li><b>Mutagen</b>: a Python module to handle audio metadata.</li>
<li><b>time</b>: This module provides various time-related functions.</li>
</ul>

I have provided proper commenting in the program to let you know which line is functioning for what.<br/>
<b> project looks like this: </b>

Feel free contribute and make changes!!
<h2>Happy Coding!!</h2>
<h3> Thank you <b>John Elder</b> for helping me create this application also to understand the functionality of python GUI and Creating the same</h3>
